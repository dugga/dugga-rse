An installation of WDSC 6.0 could not be located.  The installation can
continue, but the RSE Extensions will not be automatically installed into
WDSC for you.  If you have WDSC 6 installed, you can manually finish the
installation by copying the file com.softlanding.rse.extensions.link from
the root of the installation folder to the eclipse\links folder under the
root of your WDSC 6 installation.

For reference purposes, this is how we determine if WDSC 6 is installed:

1)  Check the following two registry keys to determine that the base RAD or
RWD product is installed, and into what folder:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Rational\Software Development Platform\products\com.ibm.rational.application.developer\location

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Rational\Software Development Platform\products\com.ibm.rational.web.developer\location

2)  Step 1 gives us the root install location for RAD/RWD which is the
base for WDSC 6.  We then confirm that the folder exists and also that there
is a sub-folder named rwdi_shared.  The presence of this sub-folder tells
us that WDSC 6 is installed.
