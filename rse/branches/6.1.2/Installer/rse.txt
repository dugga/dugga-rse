An expected installation of WDSC could not be located. (Only instances of WDSC
Version 6 are able to be recognized.)  You must complete the installation routine,
then install the RSE Extensions manually using the instructions provided after the
installation routine completes.

Detecting WDSC 6.x
------------------

For reference purposes, this is how we determine if WDSC 6 is installed:

1)  Check the following two registry keys to determine that the base RAD or
RWD product is installed, and into what folder:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Rational\Software Development Platform\products\com.ibm.rational.application.developer\location

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Rational\Software Development Platform\products\com.ibm.rational.web.developer\location

2)  Step 1 gives us the root install location for RAD/RWD which is the
base for WDSC 6.  We then confirm that the folder exists and also that there
is a sub-folder named rwdi_shared.  The presence of this sub-folder tells
us that WDSC 6 is installed.
