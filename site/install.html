<h1 style="text-align: center;">Installation/Update Instructions</h1>
<p>Here you will find a screenshot tour of the RSE Extensions installation
and update process in WDSC 6.0.</p>

<div class="h2" id="install" title="install">
<h2>Installing the RSE Extensions</h2>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Download the installer.  The latest version is always available at <a
href="http://support.softlanding.com/opensource/rse_extensions.exe">
http://support.softlanding.com/opensource/rse_extensions.exe</a>.  Once you have
it downloaded, double-click to launch the installer.</p>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Given that this is a standard Windows install wizards, the screens are fairly
self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>Step 2:</h3>
<p>This screen shows the user agreement.  As the heading says the RSE Extensions are
available under the terms of the IBM CPL v1.0, a fairly standard open source license
agreement -- the same agreement that Eclipse was originally licensed under.  Eclipse now
has their own version called the EPL.</p>

<h3>Step 3:</h3>
<p>Confirm the installation directory.  It doesn't really matter what directory you install into
except that it should be a new directory.  You would not want to install this into one of the WDSC
directories.</p>

<h3>Step 4:</h3>
<p>This screen just confirms that we detected that WDSC 6.0 is installed.  If we did not find it, you
would get a different screen that is not shown here.</p>

<h3>Step 5:</h3>
<p>Just a final confirmation screen.</p>

<h3>Step 6:</h3>
<p>The final screen, which you see after the install has completed.</p>

<h3>Next Step:</h3>
<p>With the install complete, just restart WDSC.  You might want to move on to the <a href="overview.html">overview</a>,
or perhaps you want to <a href="develop.html">participate in the development</a> of the RSE Extensions.</p>

<h2>Updating the RSE Extensions</h2>

<p>WDSC 6.0 has a feature in the preferences to automatically check for updates.  Provided you
are not behind a proxy that does not allow this feature, it should work for the RSE Extensions.  
You can manually initiate the check for updates by doing Help -&gt; Software Updates -&gt; Find and
Install.  Then just follow the wizard.<br><br>
If you are behind a proxy that does not work with WDSC, then to install updates you just
always follow the same instructions you used to install the first time.  In other words, you can always
just download the latest version of the installer and re-run it.  When you do this, the installer detects
that the RSE Extensions are already installed, and skips most of the wizard screens.</p>
