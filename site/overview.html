<h1 style="text-align: center;">RSE Extensions: An Overview</h1>
<p>This overview briefly describes the features included in the RSE Extensions.  If you
are somewhat familiar with WDSC and its Remote Systems Explorer (RSE), these screenshots should
help make the added features fairly obvious to you.  If you are not familiar with RSE, then as you become more
familiar with using WDSC you should find that these extensions just naturally fall in line with everything
else within WDSC.  The following screenshot is an example of how WDSC will likely appear when you
restart it after installing the RSE Extensions.</p>
<img src="images/overview/overview-1.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>Notice that there are new subsystems for spooled files and messages beneath your iSeries connection.  These
subsystems look and behave similarly to the other connection subsystems that WDSC contributes. </p>
<div class="h2" id="overview" title="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The RSE Extensions consists of these primary features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to manage and view iSeries <a href="#spooledfiles">spooled files.</a></li>
<li>The ability to manage and view iSeries <a href="#messages">messages.</a></li>
<li>A new "<a href="#editing">perspective</a>" that is optimized for source editing.</li>
</ol>
<p>A description of each feature follows.</p>
<div class="h3" id="spooledfiles" title="spooledfiles">
<h3>Working with Spooled Files</h3>
<p>The RSE Extensions adds a subsystem named <strong>iSeries Spooled Files</strong> to your iSeries connections.  This subsystem will
initially include one filter -- <strong>Your spooled files</strong> -- that shows you all the spooled files associated with the user profile the connection is using to access the iSeries computer.  The filter delivers results equivalent to running the WRKSPLF command on a 5250 command line. </p>
<p>The following screen shows the filter in the Remote Systems Details
table view.  It also shows a spooled file that has been opened in the built-in text editor. </p>
<img src="images/overview/spool-1.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>You can create custom filters in the spooled files subsystem just as you can in other RSE subsystems:</p>
<img src="images/overview/spool-2.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>All of the standard options for managing spooled files are available for use in the expanded filters.</p>  
<p>Because this feature is intended to make it easier for a developer to access compile listings and joblogs without leaving the IDE,  the ability to view and access more complicated spooled files, such as *AFP with overlays, is very limited.</p>
</div>

<div class="h3" id="messages" title="messages">
<h3>Working with Messages</h3>
<p>The RSE Extensions also adds a subsystem for iSeries Messages.  As with the spooled files subsystem, it implements
a standard RSE subsystem that allows you to define filters for messages.  A default "Your Messages" filter is created
automatically.  In addition to these features, which require no additional explanation, there is one other
unique feature implemented, and that is the ability to have WDSC monitor your personal message queue in the background and notify
you of new messages.  Right click on the iSeries Messages subsystem and choose Properties, then click on <strong>Message
Queue Monitoring</strong>.  A screen like this appears:</p>
<img src="images/overview/message-1.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>Initially, the Monitor Message Queue checkbox is not checked, so the remaining settings do not appear.  The settings are self-explanatory; you are indicating how you want WDSC to handle the various types of messages you receive.  If you receive an Inquiry message, WDSC can present a dialog that lets you respond to the message without leaving the IDE.</p>

<div class="h3" id="editing" title="editing">
<h3>iSeries Editing Perspective</h3>
<p>The iSeries Editing Perspective provided by the RSE Extensions is a new perspective you can switch to
when editing source.  This feature is mainly a convenience feature.  WDSC is very flexible in how you arrange
your windows.  It also lets you save those arrangements as your own perspective.  All we have done is take the best
practices we have learned over the years and package those settings up for you.  This also allows us to do the one thing
that you cannot do yourself, which is give the perspective a unique icon.  This makes it easier to visually recognize in
the list of open perspectives.  Here is a quick description of how to use this perspective:</p>
<h4>Open some source</h4>
<p>First, open a couple of members for editing in RSE.  This will make it easier to see the perspective's features.</p>  
<h4>Open the Perspective</h4>
<p>To open the perspective for the first time, do Window -&gt; Open Perspective -&gt; Other.  A screen like this appears:</p>
<img src="images/overview/persp-1.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>Select the <strong>iSeries Editing</strong> perspective.  Note that once the perspective is open, it is easy to quickly switch between open perspectives.  Just use the perspective switcher that appears in the top-right hand corner of WDSC (visible in the next screen).  The perspective looks like this:</p>
<img src="images/overview/persp-2.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>It may not look like much, but that is the point.  As you may already know, when you double click an
editor or view in any window it will expand, or "maximize," to fill the whole space.  However, when a window is maximized you can see only one window at a time.  So instead of forcing you to maximize, this perspective condenses the extra views into a set of toolbar icons at the bottom, allowing the editors to use the entire screen: </p>
<img src="images/overview/persp-3.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>Notice how we are now showing two members at the same time.  Again, you could always do this, but when you are
trying to do it at the same time that other views are showing, it is not very helpful.  With the extra screen real estate
this feature now becomes useful.  If you are not aware of how to do this, just click and drag one of the editor tabs to any
window edge.  The icon changes so you know when to drop the Window.  To undo the
effect, just drag and drop onto another editor, and WDSC will go back to stacking them.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be saying, "OK, but I need some of those views, like the Outline view, or the Remote Systems view."
Remember those icons we mentioned, on the bottom toolbar in the previous screenshot?  Those are all of the common views
you would typically need to access.  In this case, we have converted them to something WDSC calls a "Fast View."  Click
the icon for the Outline view.  Your screen now looks something like this:</p>
<img src="images/overview/persp-4.png" alt="RSE Extensions screen" />
<p>Notice how the view "slides" into place on top of your editors?  In the case of the Outline view, you can expand the outline 
and click on a field's or procedure name's line number.  This takes you to that part of the source, and the Outline view
slides back out of sight.  (You can also click the minimize button in the view, or click back in
your editor, to close the view.)  Of course, the perspective switcher makes it easy to just switch back to your other perspective to access to the views there.  Perspectives, and fast perspective switching, are among the main architectural features in the Eclipse-based IDEs.</p>
